# 🎵 Spotify Song Recommendation System

## 📌 Overview  
A **content-based music recommendation system** that suggests songs similar to your favorite tracks. By analyzing audio features through machine learning, it delivers **personalized music suggestions** that match the mood, tempo, and energy of songs you like.

---

## ✨ Features  
- 🎯 **Personalized Recommendations**  
  Get 5 songs similar to your selected track.

- 🎧 **Spotify Integration**  
  Fetches album covers and song previews using Spotify API.

- 🔊 **Audio Previews**  
  Listen to 30-second snippets of recommended songs.

- 📋 **Detailed Song Info**  
  View album name, artist, release year, and popularity score.

- 💻 **Responsive Design**  
  Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Streamlit** – Frontend framework  
- **Spotipy** – Spotify Web API wrapper  
- **Scikit-learn** – ML model using K-Nearest Neighbors  
- **Pickle** – For model serialization

---

## 🔍 How It Works  
1. The app uses the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to find similar songs.  
2. Songs are compared using audio features like:  
   - Danceability  
   - Energy  
   - Acousticness  
   - Tempo  
   - Valence  
3. Once a song is selected, the system finds similar tracks from the dataset.  
4. It then fetches additional data (cover, preview, artist, etc.) from the **Spotify API**.
